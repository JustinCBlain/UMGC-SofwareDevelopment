Suvi,"Suvirin Kedberiket (sometimes: Suverin) is a wizard played by Aabria Iyengar in The Wizard, the Witch, and the Wild One. She is known to close friends as Suvi, but to most she is the wizard Sky. Suvi is 6'0"""" and about 20 years old as of the start of the campaign. She has a lithe build and stands with a rigid and upright posture. Her skin is medium brown with golden undertones. Her face, with high cheekbones and large brown eyes tinted with teal, makes her appear somewhere between youth and adulthood.Grandmother Wren has remarked that she looks similar to her mother, Stone.
","She prefers fine, well-tailored clothing in shades of blue and white/silver (the colors of the Citadel), though she sometimes accents it with green. Her hair was black in childhood, but was turned white in a magical accident when she was 14. She dyes it a bright teal, and sometimes wears it braided and up in a bun, adorned with silver clips and chains. A censer hangs off the back of the bun, burning a drop of amber resin that gives off a spicy scent. The amber resin used in the censer was originally gifted to Suvi by Ame, and was designed to mimic the scent of Stone's cloak, but over time Suvi has altered the scent to include Grandmother Wren and her cottage as well."",""As the daughter of prominent Citadel wizards Soft and Stone, Suvi was raised in the Citadel. In 1656, when Suvi was 6 years old, the Citadel was attacked by the Dominion of Rhuv, forcing Suvi and her family to flee. Stone gave Suvi her amulet and cloak and explained that Suvi would be sent to the home of Grandmother Wren, who would take care of her. There, she met Ame and Eursulon, and they became true friends. At the end of the summer, Steel arrived to tell her that her parents had passed, and that she would be taking care of Suvi now. She took Suvi back to the Citadel to study wizardry.
When Suvi was ready, she entered Banners Court. She made friends with Hana, another student, and they developed a close (and competitive) friendship. When she was 14, she and Hana undertook an arith testing with two other classmates. Suvi channeled enough magic to cast a second level spell, which caused her so much physical strain that it turned her hair permanently white. Hana, following her, tried to outdo her friend, but wasn't able to channel the arith. She was permanently disfigured as a result.
Upon passing her Citadel examinations, Suvi was immediately placed onto the leadership track. She was the first wizard in the Citadel's history to become an archmage apprentice so early in her career, and was decades younger than any of the others in such a high station. Suvi found her ceremonial and diplomatic duties as apprentice to the archmage Silence boring; she quickly grew restless and eager to prove herself in combat.

","The ambient sounds under Suvi's musical theme as an adult includes a wine glass that Taylor Moore rubbed for a singing glass, then processed for pitch.
Some of the wizard subclasses that Aabria considered in Suvi's creation were Evocation and War Magic. She also briefly considered Abjuration, however she ""didn't want to do the same thing twice"" as she previously played the subclass for Laerryn Coramar-Seelie in Critical Role. Before eventually deciding to homebrew a subclass, Aabria built Suvi as an Order of Scribes wizard.",Suvi.png,Winter_suvi.webp
Ame,"Ame is a small, attractive witch played by Erika Ishii, east Asian in appearance. She wears a ruffled dress, a pointed witch hat, and boots. As a child, Ame was an especially small kid with her hair styled in a bowl cut with bangs.","Ame was born to a large family with many siblings. When she was 6 years old, her parents left her with Grandmother Wren. Ame remembers little about them, and believes they have no wish to see her. As a child, she had a penchant for starting projects and collections that most would consider useless or trivial. She met Suvi and Eursulon during the summer of her 7th year. By then, she had made her daily mantra ""be kind"". Ame grew up at Grandmother Wren's cottage, being trained by Grandmother Wren in the ways of witchcraft. She never connected much with the children of Toma, who saw her as a witch rather than a peer; Ame struggled with isolation during this time. As a teen, Ame traveled with Grandmother Wren to meet friends across the world, and met one of the storied Coven of Elders, upon which she would one day inherit a seat. Grandmother Wren taught Ame a technique for focusing her attention when she was stressed: to count down with her senses (6 colors, 5 textures, 4 scents, 3 sounds, 2 feelings, 1 taste).

At some point in Ame's youth, many of her memories were suppressed by a mysterious curse, along with more of Grandmother Wren's secret knowledge.","Herbalism kit, Steward's ring","Ame uses the custom Witch class, homebrewed for the campaign and character. At Level 2, she chose the Coven of the Heart subclass. These choices grant her the following abilities:

Witch's Familiar (the Fox)
Stronger abilities against those who have trifled with her
Crafting small single-use magical tokens
Ame has the Rustic Hospitality feature (likely from her custom background), and the Observant feat (increasing her Wisdom, likely from a variant human build).","Mending, Minor Illusion, Gust
",,"Ame's favorite breakfast food is rice porridge, or juk.
During the character creation process, Erika chose alchemist's tools as Ame's first proficiency. However, this tool set is then described as ""brewing tinctures and potions."" In the main campaign, Ame is said to be carrying an herbalism kit, suggesting that the terms ""alchemist's tools"" and ""herbalism kit"" are being used somewhat interchangeably.",Ame.webp,Ame_child.png
Eursulon,"Eursulon of Toma also known as Bear, a son of the Great Bear, is played by Lou Wilson. Eursulon is a spirit who is bear-like in appearance, with a feline face, ears similar to a great horned owl, and large rabbit-like feet. He has two tusks and hazel-gold eyes, a feature that he shares with his father. He is a bear-like quadruped, but prefers to stand on his hind legs, where he measures 7'5"" in height. He smells of pine and rosemary, and when he uses his magic, it has the scent of honey.

As a spirit, Eursulon uses glamour to change his appearance to stay discreet. His human form appears as a muscular, dark-skinned man about a foot shorter than he is in his natural form. His hair is red and braided down his back, and he has hazel eyes. His face bears a resemblance to Suvi reminiscent of siblings. At the Citadel, Eursulon adapted his glamour to use Citadel colors. He wore a half-cloak, a rough tunic, and a brooch with the symbol of the Citadel. This brooch marked Eursulon as an invited guest.

","Born to the The Great Bear, Eursulon grew up in the Wild Forest among his many siblings. He was closest to his sister Kalaya. One day, Eursulon accidentally crossed into the world of Kadani.

He encountered a band of knights travelling along a road, meeting Sir Curran. To pay respects to a young spirit, Sir Curran gifted Eursulon a pauldron of his golden armor, unknowingly inspiring in him a lifelong quest of seeking honor. Upon returning to the Wild Forest, Eursulon showed his pauldron to his siblings. Realizing then that he was not satisfied with his life in the world of spirits, he decided to leave to pursue the nobility, respect, and honor Curran had showed him.

When he arrived in Umora once more, he learned that hundreds of years had passed since Curran's time. He met Suvi and Ame and learned that he was no longer able to return to the spirit world.

He continued to reside with his friends and Grandmother Wren at her cottage. During this time, he received the sword Wavebreaker as a gift from Suvi, and acquired a taboo which made him unable to sleep in beds. Not long after Suvi left for the Citadel, Eursulon decided to leave as well to pursue his dream of having honor and a quest.

Five years before he would reunite with Suvi and Ame, Eursulon worked at the Tavern by the Well, an otherwise unnamed tavern in a small town. After some weeks quietly living in the inn's stables, his identity as a spirit was discovered by a band of bounty hunters who attempted to capture him. He fled the village, barely able to collect the few items he owned, including his pauldron, his sword, and the music box Ame had gifted him.

After that close call, he continued to travel far and wide across Akham. During a harsh winter in Port Talon, he was in desperate need of shelter. Finley discovered Eursulon's taboo and threatened to reveal his origins as a spirit. To buy both shelter and Finley's silence, Eursulon handed over Wavebreaker to Finley.

Still, Eursulon continued to journey, eventually arriving in Joras and joining J.B. Adelaide's troupe. The troupe was kind to him, but Adelaide grew frustrated with his inconsistency, as he would often miss performances. Eursulon gave Adelaide his music box in exchange for his continued acceptance.","Curran's Pauldron, Small round shield, Ame's music box, Wavebreaker, A piece of frayed rope from Will Gallows","Eursulon is a reskinned firbolg and has the following abilities:
