# Intro
This collection of assignments represents my learning journey. As such each is very flawed. Deadlines, incomplete knowledge, and developing skill base mean that I would do most of these assignments fundamentally differently even a few semesters down the road. 

# UMGC Students
If you're seeking to use this code in your assignments, I cannot stop you. But I hope you will at least listen to some free advice: before you hit copy-paste, ask yourself how each block works, why I've done it that way, and if there might be a better way to do it. You get out what you put in.
