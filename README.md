# Intro
This collection of assignments represents my learning journey. As such each is very flawed. Deadlines, incomplete knowledge, and a developing skill base mean that I would do most of these assignments fundamentally differently even a few semesters down the road.

# UMGC Students
If you're seeking to use this code in your assignments, at least listen to some free advice: before you **copy-paste**, ask yourself **how** each block works, **why** I've done it that way, and if there might be a **better** way. You'll get out what you put in.
